              <p> Martin Luther King Jr. is the main man who was Murdered by the cause of racism for inforcing is non-violent acts to his home place. He is the person you would see and say wow, you look great.
              I have seen some things that some people would not. The h3 is in the text and then paintte it in the side bar and then they have to float and put up next to the sidebar then float it to the right and set the margin top to 10px. I have another idea for this webiste, but i don not know what it is called and they should make it look really well. I can also comferm that everythng that this can make is in javascropt and i have to make ti in a few minutes.</p>
              
              <p>
              Mr. Ware if you are readng this, i hope this is a really great thing show... look :)  ... Omg that was soo funny i hope you can see the calls and notifications are lsilcnces when you have your iphone in the sleep mode and airplane mode, please make sure that yur phone will not blow up like thoes bombs that "you know who" has been making in the begginging of the new phone series. The yourube channel has to be in the website or i wil cry of super sadness of the times of the things and the icecream. I hope your not reading this beacuse it makes no sense.
